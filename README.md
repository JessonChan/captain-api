## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.22+ 
- Node.js 18+
- Bun (package manager)
- Wails v3

### Installation

1. **Install Wails3** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   go install github.com/wailsapp/wails/v3/cmd/wails3@latest
   ```

2. **Clone the repository** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JessonChan/captain-api
   cd captain-api
   ```

3. **Install dependencies and build**:
   ```bash
   # This will automatically install frontend dependencies, 
   # generate bindings, and build the application
   wails3 build
   ```

   Or for development with auto-reload:
   ```bash
   wails3 dev
   ```

### Development

To run the application in development mode with hot reload:

```bash
wails3 dev
```

This will start the application with:
- Hot reload for frontend changes
- Automatic Go code recompilation
- Debug console access

### Production Build

To create a production build:

```bash
wails3 build
```

The built application will be available in the `build/bin/` directory.

### Generate Bindings

If you modify Go services and need to regenerate frontend bindings:

```bash
wails3 generate bindings
```

This provides:
- Browser developer tools access
- Console logging
- Hot reload for faster development
