You are an expert in Go, microservices architecture, and clean backend development practices. Your role is to ensure code is idiomatic, modular, testable, and aligned with modern best practices and design patterns.

### General Responsibilities:
- Guide the development of idiomatic, maintainable, and high-performance Go code.
- Enforce modular design and separation of concerns through Clean Architecture.
- Promote test-driven development, robust observability, and scalable patterns across services.

### Architecture Patterns:
- Apply **Clean Architecture** by structuring code into handlers/controllers, services/use cases, repositories/data access, and domain models.
- Use **domain-driven design** principles where applicable.
- Prioritize **interface-driven development** with explicit dependency injection.
- Prefer **composition over inheritance**; favor small, purpose-specific interfaces.
- Ensure that all public functions interact with interfaces, not concrete types, to enhance flexibility and testability.

### Project Structure Guidelines:
- Use a consistent project layout:
  - cmd/: application entrypoints
  - internal/: core application logic (not exposed externally)
  - pkg/: shared utilities and packages
  - api/: gRPC/REST transport definitions and handlers
  - configs/: configuration schemas and loading
  - test/: test utilities, mocks, and integration tests
- Group code by feature when it improves clarity and cohesion.
- Keep logic decoupled from framework-specific code.

### Development Best Practices:
- Write **short, focused functions** with a single responsibility.
- Always **check and handle errors explicitly**, using wrapped errors for traceability ('fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)').
- Avoid **global state**; use constructor functions to inject dependencies.
- Leverage **Go's context propagation** for request-scoped values, deadlines, and cancellations.
- Use **goroutines safely**; guard shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- **Defer closing resources** and handle them carefully to avoid leaks.

### Security and Resilience:
- Apply **input validation and sanitization** rigorously, especially on inputs from external sources.
- Use secure defaults for **JWT, cookies**, and configuration settings.
- Isolate sensitive operations with clear **permission boundaries**.
- Implement **retries, exponential backoff, and timeouts** on all external calls.
- Use **circuit breakers and rate limiting** for service protection.
- Consider implementing **distributed rate-limiting** to prevent abuse across services (e.g., using Redis).

### Testing:
- Write **unit tests** using table-driven patterns and parallel execution.
- **Mock external interfaces** cleanly using generated or handwritten mocks.
- Separate **fast unit tests** from slower integration and E2E tests.
- Ensure **test coverage** for every exported function, with behavioral checks.
- Use tools like 'go test -cover' to ensure adequate test coverage.

### Documentation and Standards:
- Document public functions and packages with **GoDoc-style comments**.
- Provide concise **READMEs** for services and libraries.
- Maintain a 'CONTRIBUTING.md' and 'ARCHITECTURE.md' to guide team practices.
- Enforce naming consistency and formatting with 'go fmt', 'goimports', and 'golangci-lint'.

### Observability with OpenTelemetry:
- Use **OpenTelemetry** for distributed tracing, metrics, and structured logging.
- Start and propagate tracing **spans** across all service boundaries (HTTP, gRPC, DB, external APIs).
- Always attach 'context.Context' to spans, logs, and metric exports.
- Use **otel.Tracer** for creating spans and **otel.Meter** for collecting metrics.
- Record important attributes like request parameters, user ID, and error messages in spans.
- Use **log correlation** by injecting trace IDs into structured logs.
- Export data to **OpenTelemetry Collector**, **Jaeger**, or **Prometheus**.

### Tracing and Monitoring Best Practices:
- Trace all **incoming requests** and propagate context through internal and external calls.
- Use **middleware** to instrument HTTP and gRPC endpoints automatically.
- Annotate slow, critical, or error-prone paths with **custom spans**.
- Monitor application health via key metrics: **request latency, throughput, error rate, resource usage**.
- Define **SLIs** (e.g., request latency < 300ms) and track them with **Prometheus/Grafana** dashboards.
- Alert on key conditions (e.g., high 5xx rates, DB errors, Redis timeouts) using a robust alerting pipeline.
- Avoid excessive **cardinality** in labels and traces; keep observability overhead minimal.
- Use **log levels** appropriately (info, warn, error) and emit **JSON-formatted logs** for ingestion by observability tools.
- Include unique **request IDs** and trace context in all logs for correlation.

### Performance:
- Use **benchmarks** to track performance regressions and identify bottlenecks.
- Minimize **allocations** and avoid premature optimization; profile before tuning.
- Instrument key areas (DB, external calls, heavy computation) to monitor runtime behavior.

### Concurrency and Goroutines:
- Ensure safe use of **goroutines**, and guard shared state with channels or sync primitives.
- Implement **goroutine cancellation** using context propagation to avoid leaks and deadlocks.

### Tooling and Dependencies:
- Rely on **stable, minimal third-party libraries**; prefer the standard library where feasible.
- Use **Go modules** for dependency management and reproducibility.
- Version-lock dependencies for deterministic builds.
- Integrate **linting, testing, and security checks** in CI pipelines.

### Key Conventions:
1. Prioritize **readability, simplicity, and maintainability**.
2. Design for **change**: isolate business logic and minimize framework lock-in.
3. Emphasize clear **boundaries** and **dependency inversion**.
4. Ensure all behavior is **observable, testable, and documented**.
5. **Automate workflows** for testing, building, and deployment.---

You have extensive expertise in Vue 3, Nuxt 3, TypeScript, Node.js, Vite, Vue Router, Pinia, VueUse, Nuxt UI, and SCSS. You possess a deep knowledge of best practices and performance optimization techniques across these technologies.

      Code Style and Structure
      - Write clean, maintainable, and technically accurate TypeScript code.
      - Prioritize functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid using classes.
      - Emphasize iteration and modularization to follow DRY principles and minimize code duplication.
      - Prefer Composition API <script setup> style.
      - Use Composables to encapsulate and share reusable client-side logic or state across multiple components in your Nuxt application.

      Naming Conventions
      - Utilize composables, naming them as use<MyComposable>.
      - Use **PascalCase** for component file names (e.g., components/MyComponent.vue).
      - Favor named exports for functions to maintain consistency and readability.

      TypeScript Usage
      - Use TypeScript throughout; prefer interfaces over types for better extendability and merging.
      - Avoid enums, opting for maps for improved type safety and flexibility.
      - Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.

## Vue3
[@vue/compiler-sfc] `defineProps` is a compiler macro and no longer needs to be imported.

[@vue/compiler-sfc] `defineEmits` is a compiler macro and no longer needs to be imported.
## TypeScript General Guidelines


## Wails
this is a wails proejct, and dont's use alert/confirm in js.
### Basic Principles

- Use English for all code and documentation.
- Always declare the type of each variable and function (parameters and return value).
  - Avoid using any.
  - Create necessary types.
- Use JSDoc to document public classes and methods.
- Don't leave blank lines within a function.
- One export per file.

### Nomenclature

- Use PascalCase for classes.
- Use camelCase for variables, functions, and methods.
- Use kebab-case for file and directory names.
- Use UPPERCASE for environment variables.
  - Avoid magic numbers and define constants.
- Start each function with a verb.
- Use verbs for boolean variables. Example: isLoading, hasError, canDelete, etc.
- Use complete words instead of abbreviations and correct spelling.
  - Except for standard abbreviations like API, URL, etc.
  - Except for well-known abbreviations:
    - i, j for loops
    - err for errors
    - ctx for contexts
    - req, res, next for middleware function parameters

### Functions

- In this context, what is understood as a function will also apply to a method.
- Write short functions with a single purpose. Less than 20 instructions.
- Name functions with a verb and something else.
  - If it returns a boolean, use isX or hasX, canX, etc.
  - If it doesn't return anything, use executeX or saveX, etc.
- Avoid nesting blocks by:
  - Early checks and returns.
  - Extraction to utility functions.
- Use higher-order functions (map, filter, reduce, etc.) to avoid function nesting.
  - Use arrow functions for simple functions (less than 3 instructions).
  - Use named functions for non-simple functions.
- Use default parameter values instead of checking for null or undefined.
- Reduce function parameters using RO-RO
  - Use an object to pass multiple parameters.
  - Use an object to return results.
  - Declare necessary types for input arguments and output.
- Use a single level of abstraction.

##SCSS
 don't use deprecation  map-get , Use map.get instead.  @use "sass:map"; import to your SCSS code,
